I'm Sebastian, and I'm passionate about sustainability, transport and technology.

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Leeds where I look at differences in the way cities manage (govern) shared mobility modes. The objective of my research is to propose better ways to govern technology in the transport sector, especially when new technologies are led by private sector stakeholders.

I have a BSc. in electronic engineering with a minor in business administration from the Universidad de los Andes in Colombia, a Master’s Degree in Technology Project Management from the École des Mines de Saint-Étienne in France, and an MSc. in transport planning from the University of Leeds in the UK. My eclectic combination of academic studies gives me a good understanding of the topics of transport, sustainability, governance and technology.

In addition to my academic career, I am the research director at NUMO, the New Urban Mobility Alliance, and I am a Senior Project Manager for WRI's Center for Sustainable Cities.

I'm Sebastian, and I'm passionate about sustainability, transport and technology.

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Leeds where I look at the difference in governance approaches that cities have taken to address the issue of shared mobility, in order to propose better ways to govern technology in the transport sector.

I have a BSc. in electronic engineering from the Universidad de los Andes in Colombia, an MSc. in transport planning from the University of Leeds in the UK, and a Master’s Degree in Technology Project Management from the École des Mines de Saint-Étienne in France. My eclectic combination of academic studies gives me a good opportunity to combine my interests in transport, sustainability and technology.

In addition to my academic career, I am the research director at NUMO, the New Urban Mobility Alliance, and I am a project manager for WRI's Center for Sustainable Cities.

Feel free to contact me using any of the channels on the left!
